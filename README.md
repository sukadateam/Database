Discord Server: Message Me If You Wish To Help. Thank You!
<br>A custom database handler. Still in development.

To setup. Install all items in requirements.txt using pip and run custom_database.py. That's it!
<br>pip install -r requirements.txt
<br>python3 -m pip install -r requirments.txt

<br>Please note: Windows And MacOS are currently be used for application testing.
<br><br>Nerdy Stuff:<br>For the absolute latest version download the source code. Not in releases. May cause issues. It won't always be tested before updated. Do not do this if you are looking for a stable version.

<br>Latest Notes:<br>1. macOS, Windows, Linux, and PyDroid all support this app.
<br>2. Updates are being released at a rapid pace. Some builds may not be usuable. If so, use a previous version.

To start the program:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt (Universal) or python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt (MacOS/UnAssigned)

2. Edit settings.py and scroll to the bottom and set side_tilt=330 to side_tilt=80
#MacOS and Windows has a different ratio port so this is needed.

3. Recommended python 3.10.2. if else: change required_version to your version in settings.py

4. Open Shell.py with python.

5. Enter 7, 1, 1. Now create a user. Use permission (admin).

6. Exit shell and open app.py and login. After login it will ask you to create a encrypt/decrypt password.
