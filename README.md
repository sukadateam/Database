# A 3 year long project. It's so close to it's first 1.0 release!
This project is being continued. Rebuilding, optimizations and code cleanup is in progress! Goto live build to see even more new features!
 - Setup instructions need to be updated. They will appear here after they have been written. In progress, almost done.

<br>Current Python Version: 3.11.7 - Currently used for dev
<br>Please note: Only MacOS is currently be used for application testing. Windows support has been dropped. Might be revisited in the future.


<br> To Install updates via the UpdatePrgram.py file. Just download "UpdateCommands.py" from the new release tab, and place it in the same directory; within the current install, within the same folder as UpdateProgram.py

To start the program:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt (Universal) or python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt (MacOS/UnAssigned)

3. Recommended python 3.10.?. if else: change required_version to your version in settings.py

3. Open app.py and login. After login it may ask you to create a encrypt/decrypt password.

If NumPy is giving erros try: (Termux Only)
<br>   MATHLIB="m" pip install -r requirements.txt

<br>To get live version(s) check out github.com/sukadateam/live_build

  - I'd like to note that the people listed above have not helped in development since I left high school. It's been a solo project for a few years. I'd like to thank them for their help in the kick start of this project. I will keep the development going by myself. Thank you all! You are more than welcome to rejoin the progress at any time!


Current Working/Partially working without major issues are:
StudentManager --> ()
Users --> ()
data_base --> ()
Note: Backing away from going a full release as there are tons of issues. I'm hoping to address them all before adding new featrues, or finishing some features. I will be going function by function testing everything. I will release a list of all teseted and working functions right here: (Happy 420!!)
